## Constants and variables in a programming language

The difference between a variable and a constant is very simple. A variable is able to change it's value or rather able to change where it points to in relation to retrieving data information. However a constant is something that can't have where's it's pointing to changed. In python, we can do this by importing variables from different modules

The advantages of using them named are the same as naming normal variables. They are more easily used and are better for when someone who isn't you needs to link at the code.
