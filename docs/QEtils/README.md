QEtils are utilities that are meant to either aid the learning of python at my school or provide help to more easily do things. This is something that i came up with on my endless quest to find something that i actually want to dedicate some of my time to and not give up on half way through finishing.

Because of it being a library comprised of different modules, the modules below are listed as well as the links to their respective documentation
